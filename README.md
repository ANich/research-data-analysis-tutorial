My talk for the CS Tools Tips and Tricks Seminar: https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/events/251/


## Title: Looking at your data with Jupyter and Pandas

  
Prerequisite: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

Install Jupyter: https://jupyter.org/install

Install JupyterLab: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab#installation

  
#### Overview: This will be an introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks(/Lab) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to do some data analysis. We will also explore some tips and tricks for fitting these tools into a research workflow.


#### Goals:

- To introduce you to some tools you might want to know if you're looking for a job that requires you to work with data.

- To provide some tools that make you a more productive researcher when making illustrations, tables and artifacts, and why it makes sense to put this in Jupyter.
